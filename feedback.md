## Code Comments:

Please take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on your code. Let me know if you have any questions about these!

## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

**3: Excelling.** Your deployed app works just like your local one!

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**2: Performing.** Good job getting the basic functionality down for the game. I think the next crucial step for you is to update the game so that it displays which guesses are correct vs. incorrect (i.e., update the "underscored" word so that it contains correct letters as they are guessed). It seems you're already updating the word in your code. You just need to update the DOM next. Let me know if you have questions about how to do this.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**1: Progressing.** I would recommend removing (a) any code you don't use, like that first chunk of canvas code, and (b) `console.log` statements. That will go along way in making your code much readable. I included some notes about that in my inline code comments.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**2: Performing.** Good job here. One way I think you could improve the user interface is to display the "underscored" word in something other than a text input. We usually only use inputs if the intention is to have the user type something into them.
